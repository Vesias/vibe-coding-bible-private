**Bug Categories:**
1. **Syntax Errors** (1 minute each) - 2 bugs
2. **Logic Errors** (2 minutes each) - 2 bugs  
3. **Runtime Errors** (3 minutes each) - 2 bugs
4. **Performance Issues** (4 minutes each) - 2 bugs
5. **Complex System Bugs** (5 minutes each) - 2 bugs

**Sample Bug Scenarios:**

**Level 1: Syntax Error**
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0
  for (let item of items) {
    total += item.price * item.quantity
  }
  return total
}

// Bug: Missing semicolons causing ASI issues in production minification
```

**Level 3: Runtime Error**
```javascript
async function loadUserData(userId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  const userData = await response.json();
  return userData.profile.preferences.theme;
}

// Bug: No error handling for missing nested properties
```

**Level 5: Complex System Bug**
```javascript
// Memory leak in React component with event listeners
const useWebSocket = (url) => {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null);
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(url);
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, JSON.parse(event.data)]);

# Implement GitFlow workflow
git flow init
git flow feature start user-authentication
# ... develop feature ...
git flow feature publish user-authentication
git flow feature finish user-authentication

# Alternative: GitHub Flow

git apply 0001-feature-patch.patch

# Use git bisect to find bugs
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0.0
# Git will checkout commits to test

# Stash management
git stash push -m "WIP: user profile feature"
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

**Level 5: Git Hooks and Automation (5 minutes)**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Run linting and tests before commit

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run linter
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then

```
SaaS Metrics Calculation:

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
Sales & Marketing Spend: $50,000/month
